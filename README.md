# Crowdshotâ€”Eyes everywhere

A concept in React Native, Firebase, backend NodeJS, Elasticsearch, AWS EC2, and the Stripe API. Fully functional with a very polished UI/UX experience, from a complete payment system (with Stripe integration and internal hand-rolled credit accounts), rewards store and checkout, interactive voting, messaging, and more. A month and half was spent on this with a team of 3.

I have no idea why we never launched this, because it's production ready. Reach out if you're interested, or want to work with me in the future: ken@kenma.ca

The backend for this can be found a separate (private) repo.
